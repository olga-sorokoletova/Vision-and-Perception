# StyleGAN encoder for image-to-image translation

This is the repository of the project proposed for the course of *Vision and Perception*.

This work is centered on the idea of developing the generic **pixel2style2pixel(pSp)** framework presented in the paper [Richardson et al, **"Encoding in Style: a StyleGAN Encoder for Image-to-Image Translation,"** (IROS 2016)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00951) and aplicable  on a large variety of **image-to-image translation** tasks. It is implemented in Tensorflow.
